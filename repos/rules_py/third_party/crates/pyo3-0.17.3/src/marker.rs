//! Fundamental properties of objects tied to the Python interpreter.
//!
//! The Python interpreter is not threadsafe. To protect the Python interpreter in multithreaded
//! scenarios there is a global lock, the *global interpreter lock* (hereafter referred to as *GIL*)
//! that must be held to safely interact with Python objects. This is why in PyO3 when you acquire
//! the GIL you get a [`Python`] marker token that carries the *lifetime* of holding the GIL and all
//! borrowed references to Python objects carry this lifetime as well. This will statically ensure
//! that you can never use Python objects after dropping the lock - if you mess this up it will be
//! caught at compile time and your program will fail to compile.
//!
//! It also supports this pattern that many extension modules employ:
//! - Drop the GIL, so that other Python threads can acquire it and make progress themselves
//! - Do something independently of the Python interpreter, like IO, a long running calculation or
//! awaiting a future
//! - Once that is done, reacquire the GIL
//!
//! That API is provided by [`Python::allow_threads`] and enforced via the [`Ungil`] bound on the
//! closure and the return type. This is done by relying on the [`Send`] auto trait. `Ungil` is
//! defined as the following:
//!
//! ```rust
//! pub unsafe trait Ungil {}
//!
//! unsafe impl<T: Send> Ungil for T {}
//! ```
//!
//! We piggy-back off the `Send` auto trait because it is not possible to implement custom auto
//! traits on stable Rust. This is the solution which enables it for as many types as possible while
//! making the API usable.
//!
//! In practice this API works quite well, but it comes with some drawbacks:
//!
//! ## Drawbacks
//!
//! There is no reason to prevent `!Send` types like [`Rc`] from crossing the closure. After all,
//! [`Python::allow_threads`] just lets other Python threads run - it does not itself launch a new
//! thread.
//!
//! ```rust, compile_fail
//! # #[cfg(feature = "nightly")]
//! # compile_error!("this actually works on nightly")
//! use pyo3::prelude::*;
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     Python::with_gil(|py| {
//!         let rc = Rc::new(5);
//!
//!         py.allow_threads(|| {
//!             // This would actually be fine...
//!             println!("{:?}", *rc);
//!         });
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Because we are using `Send` for something it's not quite meant for, other code that
//! (correctly) upholds the invariants of [`Send`] can cause problems.
//!
//! [`SendWrapper`] is one of those. Per its documentation:
//!
//! > A wrapper which allows you to move around non-Send-types between threads, as long as you
//! > access the contained value only from within the original thread and make sure that it is
//! > dropped from within the original thread.
//!
//! This will "work" to smuggle Python references across the closure, because we're not actually
//! doing anything with threads:
//!
//! ```rust, no_run
//! use pyo3::prelude::*;
//! use pyo3::types::PyString;
//! use send_wrapper::SendWrapper;
//!
//! Python::with_gil(|py| {
//!     let string = PyString::new(py, "foo");
//!
//!     let wrapped = SendWrapper::new(string);
//!
//!     py.allow_threads(|| {
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "nightly"))]
//! # {
//!         // ðŸ’¥ Unsound! ðŸ’¥
//!         let smuggled: &PyString = *wrapped;
//!         println!("{:?}", smuggled);
//! # }
//!     });
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! For now the answer to that is "don't do that".
//!
//! # A proper implementation using an auto trait
//!
//! However on nightly Rust and when PyO3's `nightly` feature is
//! enabled, `Ungil` is defined as the following:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(FALSE)]
//! # {
//! #![feature(auto_traits, negative_impls)]
//!
//! pub unsafe auto trait Ungil {}
//!
//! // It is unimplemented for the `Python` struct and Python objects.
//! impl !Ungil for Python<'_> {}
//! impl !Ungil for ffi::PyObject {}
//!
//! // `Py` wraps it in  a safe api, so this is OK
//! unsafe impl <T> Ungil for Py<T> {}
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! With this feature enabled, the above two examples will start working and not working, respectively.
//!

/// A marker token that represents holding the GIL.
///
/// It serves three main purposes:
/// - It provides a global API for the Python interpreter, such as [`Python::eval`].
/// - It can be passed to functions that require a proof of holding the GIL, such as
/// [`Py::clone_ref`].
/// - Its lifetime represents the scope of holding the GIL which can be used to create Rust
/// references that are bound to it, such as `&`[`PyAny`].
///
/// Note that there are some caveats to using it that you might need to be aware of. See the
/// [Deadlocks](#deadlocks) and [Releasing and freeing memory](#releasing-and-freeing-memory)
/// paragraphs for more information about that.
///
/// # Obtaining a Python token
///
/// The following are the recommended ways to obtain a [`Python`] token, in order of preference:
/// - In a function or method annotated with [`#[pyfunction]`](crate::pyfunction) or [`#[pymethods]`](crate::pymethods) you can declare it
/// as a parameter, and PyO3 will pass in the token when Python code calls it.
/// - If you already have something with a lifetime bound to the GIL, such as `&`[`PyAny`], you can
/// use its [`.py()`][PyAny::py] method to get a token.
/// - When you need to acquire the GIL yourself, such as when calling Python code from Rust, you
/// should call [`Python::with_gil`] to do that and pass your code as a closure to it.
///
/// # Deadlocks
///
/// Note that the GIL can be temporarily released by the Python interpreter during a function call
/// (e.g. importing a module). In general, you don't need to worry about this because the GIL is
/// reacquired before returning to the Rust code:
///
/// ```text
/// `Python` exists   |=====================================|
/// GIL actually held |==========|         |================|
/// Rust code running |=======|                |==|  |======|
/// ```
///
/// This behaviour can cause deadlocks when trying to lock a Rust mutex while holding the GIL:
///
///  * Thread 1 acquires the GIL
///  * Thread 1 locks a mutex
///  * Thread 1 makes a call into the Python interpreter which releases the GIL
///  * Thread 2 acquires the GIL
///  * Thread 2 tries to locks the mutex, blocks
///  * Thread 1's Python interpreter call blocks trying to reacquire the GIL held by thread 2
///
/// To avoid deadlocking, you should release the GIL before trying to lock a mutex or `await`ing in
/// asynchronous code, e.g. with [`Python::allow_threads`].
///
/// # Releasing and freeing memory
///
/// The [`Python`] type can be used to create references to variables owned by the Python
/// interpreter, using functions such as [`Python::eval`] and [`PyModule::import`]. These
/// references are tied to a [`GILPool`] whose references are not cleared until it is dropped.
/// This can cause apparent "memory leaks" if it is kept around for a long time.
///
/// ```rust
/// use pyo3::prelude::*;
/// use pyo3::types::PyString;
///
/// # fn main () -> PyResult<()> {
/// Python::with_gil(|py| -> PyResult<()> {
///     for _ in 0..10 {
///         let hello: &PyString = py.eval("\"Hello World!\"", None, None)?.extract()?;
///         println!("Python says: {}", hello.to_str()?);
///         // Normally variables in a loop scope are dropped here, but `hello` is a reference to
///         // something owned by the Python interpreter. Dropping this reference does nothing.
///     }
///     Ok(())
/// })
/// // This is where the `hello`'s reference counts start getting decremented.
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The variable `hello` is dropped at the end of each loop iteration, but the lifetime of the
/// pointed-to memory is bound to [`Python::with_gil`]'s [`GILPool`] which will not be dropped until
/// the end of [`Python::with_gil`]'s scope. Only then is each `hello`'s Python reference count
/// decreased. This means that at the last line of the example there are 10 copies of `hello` in
/// Python's memory, not just one at a time as we might expect from Rust's [scoping rules].
///
/// See the [Memory Management] chapter of the guide for more information about how PyO3 uses
/// [`GILPool`] to manage memory.
